# Student Performance Machine Learning Analysis

## Overview

This project analyses student mathematics performance using machine learning techniques developed in **Jupyter Notebook**. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualisation, and predictive modelling using both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches.

The main objective is to build and evaluate models capable of predicting student outcomes based on academic and behavioural features.
